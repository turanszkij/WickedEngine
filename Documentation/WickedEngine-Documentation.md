## High Level Interface
The high level interface consists of classes that allow for extending the engine with custom functionality. This is usually done by overriding the classes.

### MainComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/MainComponent.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/MainComponent.cpp)
This is the main runtime component that has the Run() function. It should be included in the application entry point while calling Run() in an infinite loop. <br/>
The MainComponent has many uses that the user is not necessarily interested in. The most important part is that it manages the RenderPaths. There can be one active RenderPath at a time, which will be updated and rendered to the screen every frame. However, because a RenderPath is a highly customizable class, there is no limitation what can be done within the RenderPath, for example supporting multiple concurrent RenderPaths if required. RenderPaths can be switched wit ha Fade out screen easily. Loading Screen can be activated as an active Renderpath and it will load and switch to an other RenderPath if desired. A RenderPath can be simply activated with the MainComponent::ActivatePath() function.<br/>
The MainComponent does the following every frame while it is running:<br/>
1. FixedUpdate() <br/>
Calls FixedUpdate for the active RenderPath and wakes up scripts that are waiting for fixedupdate(). The frequency off calls will be determined by MainComponent::setTargetFrameRate(float framespersecond). By default (parameter = 60), FixedUpdate will be called 60 times per second.
2. Update(float deltatime) <br/>
Calls Update for the active RenderPath and wakes up scripts that are waiting for update()
3. Render() <br/>
Calls Render for the active RenderPath and wakes up scripts that are waiting for render()
4. Compose()
Calls Compose for the active RenderPath

### RenderPath
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath.h)
This is an empty base class that can be activated with a MainComponent. It calls its Start(), Update(), FixedUpdate(), Render(), Compose(), Stop() functions as needed. Override this to perform custom gameplay or rendering logic. <br/>
The order in which the functions are executed every frame: <br/>
1. PreUpdate() <br/>
This will be called once per frame before any script that calls Update().
2. FixedUpdate() <br/>
This will be called in a manner that is deterministic, so logic will be running in the frequency that is specified with MainComponent::setTargetFrameRate(float framespersecond)
3. Update(float deltatime) <br/>
This will be called once per frame, and the elapsed time in seconds since the last Update() is provided as parameter
4. PostUpdate() <br/>
This will be called once per frame after any script that calls Update().
5. Render() const <br/>
This will be called once per frame. It is const, so it shouldn't modify state. When running this, it is not defined which thread it is running on. Multiple threads and job system can be used within this. The main purpose is to record mass rendering commands in multiple threads and command lists. Command list can be safely retrieved at this point from the graphics device. 
6. Compose(CommandList cmd) const <br/>
It is called once per frame. It is running on a single command list that it receives as a parameter. These rendering commands will directly record onto the last submitted command list in the frame. The render target is the back buffer at this point, so rendering will happen to the screen.

Apart from the functions that will be run every frame, the RenderPath has the following functions:
1. Load() <br/> 
Intended for loading resources before the first time the RenderPath will be used. It will be callsed by [LoadingScreen](#loadingscreen) to load resources in the background.
2. Start() <br/>
Start will always be called when a RenderPath is activated by the MainComponent
3. Stop() <br/>
Stop will be always called when the current RenderPath was the active one in MainComponent, but an other one was activated.

### RenderPath2D
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath2D.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath2D.cpp)
Capable of handling 2D rendering to offscreen buffer in Render() function, or just the screen in Compose() function. It has some functionality to render wiSprite and wiSpriteFont onto rendering layers and stenciling with 3D rendered scene. It has a [GUI](#gui) that is automatically updated and rendered if any elements have been added to it.

### RenderPath3D
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath3D.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath3D.cpp)
Base class for implementing 3D rendering paths. It also supports everything that the Renderpath2D does.

The post process chain is also implemented here. This means that the order of the post processes and the resources that they use are defined here, but the individual post process rendering on a lower level is implemented in the `wiRenderer` as core engine features. Read more about post process implementation in the [wiRenderer section](#post-processing). 

The post process chain is implemented in `RenderPath3D::RenderPostprocessChain()` function and divided into multiple parts:
- HDR<br/>
These are using the HDR scene render targets, they happen before tone mapping. For example: Temporal AA, Motion blur, Depth of field
- LDR<br/>
These are running after tone mapping. For example: Color grading, FXAA, chromatic aberration. The last LDR post process result will be output to the back buffer in the `Compose()` function.
- Other<br/>
These are running in more specific locations, depending on the render path. For example: SSR, SSAO, cartoon outline

The HDR and LDR post process chain are using the "ping-ponging" technique, which means when the first post process consumes texture1 and produces texture2, then the following post process will consume texture2 and produce texture1, until all post processes are rendered.

### RenderPath3D_PathTracing
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath3D_PathTracing.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/RenderPath3D_PathTracing.cpp)
Implements a compute shader based path tracing solution. In a static scene, the rendering will converge to ground truth. When something changes in the scene (something moves, ot material changes, etc...), the convergence will be restarted from the beginning. The raytracing is implemented in [wiRenderer](#wirenderer) and multiple [shaders](#shaders). The ray tracing is available on any GPU that supports compute shaders.

### LoadingScreen
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/LoadingScreen.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/LoadingScreen.cpp)
Render path that can be easily used for loading screen. It is able to load content or RenderPath in the background and switch to an other RenderPath onceit finished.

## System
You can find out more about the Entity-Component system and other engine-level systems under ENGINE/System filter in the solution.
### wiECS
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiECS.h)

#### ComponentManager
This is the core entity-component relationship handler class. The purpose of this is to efficiently store, remove, add and sort components. Components can be any movable C++ structure. The best components are simple POD (plain old data) structures.

#### Entity
Entity is a number, it can reference components through ComponentManager containers. An entity is always valid if it exists. It's not required that an entity has any components. An entity has a component, if there is a ComponentManager that has a component which is associated with the same entity.

### wiScene
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
The logical scene representation using the Entity-Component System
- GetScene <br/>
Returns a global scene instance. The wiRenderer will use this scene instance to render the scene. The user can create multiple scenes as well, and merge those into the global scene so that those will be rendered as well.
- LoadModel() <br/>
There are two flavours to this. One of them immediately loads into the global scene. The other loads into a custom scene, which is usefult to manage the contents separately. This function will return an Entity that represents the root transform of the scene - if the attached parameter was true, otherwise it will return INVALID_ENTITY and no root transform will be created.
- Pick <br/>
Allows to pick the closest object with a RAY (closest ray intersection hit to the ray origin). The user can provide a custom scene or layermask to filter the objects to be checked.
- SceneIntersectSphere <br/>
Performs sphere intersection with all objects and returns the first occured intersection immediately. The result contains the incident normal and penetration depth and the contact object entity ID.
- SceneIntersectCapsule <br/>
Performs capsule intersection with all objects and returns the first occured intersection immediately. The result contains the incident normal and penetration depth and the contact object entity ID.

Below you will find the structures that make up the scene. These are intended to be simple strucutres that will be held in [ComponentManagers](#componentmanager). Keep these structures minimal in size to use cache efficiently when iterating a large amount of components.

<b>Note on bools: </b> using bool in C++ structures is inefficient, because they take up more space in memory than required. Instead, bitmasks will be used in every component that can store up to 32 bool values in each bit. This also makes it easier to add bool flags and not having to worry about serializing them, because the bitfields themselves are already serialized (but the order of flags must never change without handling possible side effects with serialization versioning!). C++ enums are used in the code to manage these bool flags, and the bitmask storing these is always called `uint32_t _flags;` For example:

```cpp
enum FLAGS
{
	EMPTY = 0, // always have empty as first flag (value of zero)
	RENDERABLE = 1 << 0,
	DOUBLE_SIDED = 1 << 1,
	DYNAMIC = 1 << 2,
};
uint32_t _flags = EMPTY; // default value is usually EMPTY, indicating that no flags are set

// How to query the "double sided" flag:
bool IsDoubleSided() const { return _flags & DOUBLE_SIDED; }

// How to set the "double sided" flag
void SetDoubleSided(bool value) { if (value) { _flags |= DOUBLE_SIDED; } else { _flags &= ~DOUBLE_SIDED; } }
```

It is good practice to not implement constructors and destructors for components. Wherever possible, initialization of values in declaration should be preferred. If desctructors are defined, move contructors, etc. will also need to be defined for compatibility with the [ComponentManager](#componentmanager), so default constructors and destructors should be preferred. Member objects should be able to desctruct themselves implicitly. If pointers need to be stored within the component that manage object lifetime, std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr can be used, which will be destructed implicitly.

#### NameComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A string to identify an entity with a human readable name.

#### LayerComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A bitmask that can be used to filter entities.

#### TransformComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Orientation in 3D space, which supports various common operations on itself.

#### PreviousFrameTransformComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Absolute orientation in the previous frame (a matrix).

#### HierarchyComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
An entity can be part of a transform hierarchy by having this component. Some other properties can also be inherieted, such as layer bitmask. If an entity has a parent, then it has a HierarchyComponent, otherwise it's not part of a hierarchy.

#### MaterialComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Several properties that define a material, like color, textures, etc...

#### MeshComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A mesh is an array of triangles. A mesh can have multiple parts, called MeshSubsets. Each MeshSubset has a material and it is using a range of triangles of the mesh. This can also have GPU resident data for rendering.

#### ImpostorComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Supports efficient rendering of the same mesh multiple times (but as an approximation, such as a billboard cutout). A mesh can be rendered as impostors for example when it is not important, but has a large number of copies.

#### ObjectComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
An ObjectComponent is an instance of a mesh that has physical location in a 3D world. Multiple ObjectComponents can have the same mesh, and in this case the mesh will be rendered multiple times efficiently. It is expected that an entity that has ObjectComponent, also has TransformComponent and [AABB](#aabb) (axis aligned bounding box) component.

#### RigidBodyPhysicsComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Stores properties required for rigid body physics simulation and a handle that will be used by the physicsengine internally.

#### SoftBodyPhysicsComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Stores properties required for soft body physics simulation and a handle that will be used by the physicsengine internally.

#### ArmatureComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A skeleton used for skinning deformation of meshes.

#### LightComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A light in the scene that can shine in the darkness. It is expected that an entity that has LightComponent, also has TransformComponent and [AABB](#aabb) (axis aligned bounding box) component.

#### CameraComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)

#### EnvironmentProbeComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
It is expected that an entity that has EnvironmentProbeComponent, also has TransformComponent and [AABB](#aabb) (axis aligned bounding box) component.

#### ForceFieldComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)

#### DecalComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
It is expected that an entity that has DecalComponent, also has TransformComponent and [AABB](#aabb) (axis aligned bounding box) component.

#### AnimationComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)

#### WeatherComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)

#### SoundComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
Holds a Sound and a SoundInstance, and it can be placed into the scene via a TransformComponent. It can have a 3D audio effect it has a TransformComponent.

#### InverseKinematicsComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
If an entity has an `InverseKinematicComponent` (IK), and part of a transform hierarchy (has both [TransformComponent](#transformcomponent) and a [HierarchyComponent](#hierarchycomponent)), then it can be targetted to an other [ThransformComponent](#transformcomponent). The parent transforms will be computed in order to let the IK reach the target if possible. The parent transforms will be only rotated. For example, if a hand tries to reach for an object, the hand and shoulder will move accordingly to let the hand reach.
The `chain_length` can be specified to let the IK system know how many parents should be computed. It can be greater than the real chain length, in that case there will be no more simulation steps than the length of hierarchy chain.
The `iteration_count` can be specified to increase accuracy of the computation.
If animations are also playing on the affected entities, the IK system will override the animations.

#### SpringComponent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
An entity can have a `SpringComponent` to achieve a "jiggle" or "soft" animation effect programatically. The effect will work automatically if the transform is changed by animation system for example, or in any other way. The parameter `stiffness` specifies how fast the transform tries to go back to its initial position. The parameter `damping` specifies how fast the transform comes to rest position. The `wind_affection` parameter specifies how much the global wind applies to the spring.

#### Scene
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiScene.cpp)
A scene is a collection of component arrays. The scene is updating all the components in an efficient manner using the [job system](#wijobsystem). It can be serialized and saved/loaded from disk efficiently.
- Update(float deltatime) <br/>
This function runs all the requied systems to update all components contained within the Scene.

### wiJobSystem
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiJobSystem.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiJobSystem.cpp)
Manages the execution of concurrent tasks
- context <br/>
Defines a single workload that can be synchronized. It is used to issue jobs from within jobs and properly wait for completion. A context can be simply created on the stack because it is a simple atomic counter.
- Execute <br/>
This will schedule a task for execution on a separate thread for a given workload
- Dispatch <br/>
This will schedule a task for execution on multiple parallel threads for a given workload
- Wait <br/>
This function will block until all jobs have finished for a given workload. The current thread starts working on any work left to be finished.

### wiInitializer
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiInitializer.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiInitializer.cpp)
Initializes all engine systems either in a blocking or an asynchronous way.

### wiPlatform
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiPlatform.h)
You can get native platform specific handles here, such as window handle.
- GetWindow <br/>
Returns the platform specific window handle
- IsWindowActive <br/>
Returns true if the current window is the topmost one, false if it is not in focus

### wiEvent
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiEvent.h)
The event system can be used to execute system-wide tasks. Any system can "subscribe" to events and any system can "fire" events.
- Subscribe <br/>
The first parameter is the event ID. Core system events are negative numbers. The user can choose any positive number to create custom events. 
The second parameter is a function to be executed, with a userdata argument. The userdata argument can hold any custom data that the user desires.
The return value is a wiEvent::Handle type. When this is object is destroyed, the event is subscription for the function will be removed.
Multiple functions can be subscribed to a single event ID.
- FireEvent <br/>
The first argument is the event id, that says which events to invoke. 
The second argument will be passed to the subscribed event's userdata parameter.
All events that are subsribed to the specified event id will run immediately at the time of the call of FireEvent. The order of execution among events is the order of which they were subscribed.


## Graphics
Everything related to rendering graphics will be discussed below

### wiGraphics
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiGraphics.h)
The graphics API wrappers

#### GraphicsDevice
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiGraphicsDevice.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiGraphicsDevice.cpp)
This is the interface for the graphics API abstraction. It is higher level than a graphics API, but these are the lowest level of rendering commands the engine offers.

##### Debug device
When creating a graphics device, it can be created in special debug mode to assist development. For this, the user can specify `debugdevice` as command line argument to the application, or set the `debuglayer` argument of the graphics device constructor to `true` when creating the device. The errors will be posted to the Console Output window in the development environment.

##### Creating resources
Functions like `CreateTexture()`, `CreateBuffer()`, etc. can be used to create corresponding GPU resources. Using these functions is thread safe. The resources will not necessarily be created immediately, but by the time the GPU will want to use them. These functions imediately return `false` if there were any errors, such as wrong parameters being passed to the description parameters, and they will return `true` if everything is correct. If there was an error, please use the [debug device](#debug-device) functionality to get additional information. When passing a resource to these functions that is already created, it will be destroyed, then created again with the newly provided parameters.

##### Destroying resources
Resources will be destroyed automatically by the graphics device when they are no longer used.

##### Work submission
Rendering commands that expect a `CommandList` as a parameter are not executed immediately. They will be recorded into command lists and submitted to the GPU for execution upon calling the `PresentEnd()` function. The `CommandList` is a simple handle that associates rendering commands to a CPU execution timeline. The `CommandList` is not thread safe, so every `CommandList` can be used by a single CPU thread at a time to record commands. In a multithreading scenario, each CPU thread should have its own `CommandList`. `CommandList`s can be retrieved from the [GraphicsDevice](#graphicsdevice) by calling `GraphicsDevice::BeginCommandList()` that will return a `CommandList` handle that is free to be used from that point by the calling thread. All such handles will be in use until `SubmitCommandLists()` or `PresentEnd()` was called, where GPU submission takes place. The command lists will be submitted in the order they were retrieved with `GraphicsDevice::BeginCommandList()`. The order of submission correlates with the order of actual GPU execution. For example:

```cpp
CommandList cmd1 = device->BeginCommandList();
CommandList cmd2 = device->BeginCommandList();

Read_Shadowmaps(cmd2); // CPU executes these commands first
Render_Shadowmaps(cmd1); // CPU executes these commands second

//...

CommandList cmd_present = device->BeginCommandList();
device->PresentBegin(cmd_present);
// ...
device->PresentEnd(cmd_present); // CPU submits work for GPU
// The GPU will execute the Render_Shadowmaps() commands first, then the Read_Shadowmaps() commands second
// The GPU will execute the commands between PresentBegin() and PresentEnd() last.
// PresentEnd displays the final image (render command executed between PresentBegin and PresentEnd) to the screen
```

In specific circumstances, when outputting the final image to the screen is not immediately required, the `SubmitCommandLists()` option can also be used to submit and execute GPU work:

```cpp
CommandList cmd1 = device->BeginCommandList();
CommandList cmd2 = device->BeginCommandList();

// Record something with command lists...

device->SubmitCommandLists(); // CPU submits work for GPU
// The GPU will execute commands recorded with cmd1, then cmd2
```

When submitting command lists with `SubmitCommandLists()` or `PresentEnd()`, the CPU can be blocked in cases when there is too much GPU work submitted already that didn't finish.

Furthermore, the `BeginCommandList()` is thread safe, so the user can call it from worker threads if ordering between command lists is not a requirement (such as when they are producing workloads that are independent of each other).

##### Presenting to the screen
The `PresentBegin()` and `PresentEnd()` functions are used to prepare for rendering to the back buffer. When the `PresentBegin()` is called, the back buffer will be set as the current active render target or render pass. This means, that rendering commands will draw directly to the screen. This is generally used to draw textures that were previously rendered to, or 2D GUI elements. For example, the `RenderPath3D::Compose()` function is used in the [High Level Interface](#high-level-interface) to draw the results of the `RenderPath3D::Render()`, and the [GUI](#gui) elements. The rendering commands executed between `PresentBegin()` and `PresentEnd()` are still executed by the GPU in the command list beginning order described in the topic: [Work submission](#work-submission).

##### Resource binding (Simple)
The resource binding model is based on DirectX 11. That means, resources are bound to slot numbers that are simple integers. This makes it easy to share binding information between shaders and C++ code, just define the bind slot number as global constants in [shared header files](#shaderinterop). For sharing, the bind slot numbers can be easily defined as compile time constants using:

```cpp
static const uint my_texture_bind_slot = 5;
```
Watch out that it must be defined as `static const`, otherwise the shader compiler can interpret it as a constant buffer member (uniform). In that case, the initial value might be lost because the shader expect the CPU to feed it at runtime from a buffer. Optionally, an other choice is to use macros to define the bind point constants:
```cpp
#define MY_TEXTURE_BIND_SLOT 5
```
After this, you can declare a texture in shader and put it to the desired bind point:
```cpp
TEXTURE2D(myTexture, float4, my_texture_bind_slot);
```
Note that using the TEXTURE2D() macro to declare the resource is a cross platform way to declare a texture resource on a specified slot. For information about other resource declaration macros like this, visit the [Shaders](#shaders) section.

After this, the user can bind the texture resource from the CPU side:
```cpp
Texture myTexture;
// after texture was created, etc:
device->BindResource(PS, myTexture, my_texture_bind_slot, cmd);
```

Other than this, resources like `Texture` can have different subresources, so an extra parameter can be specified to the `BindResources()` function called `subresource`:
```cpp
Texture myTexture;
// after texture was created, etc:
device->BindResource(PS, myTexture, my_texture_bind_slot, cmd, 42);
```
By default, the `subresource` parameter is `-1`, which means that the entire resource will be bound. For more information about subresources, see the [Subresources](#subresources) section.

There are different resource types regarding how to bind resources. These slots have separate binding points from each other, so they don't interfere between each other.
- Shader resources<br/>
These are read only resources. `GPUBuffer`s and `Texture`s can be bound as shader resources if they were created with a `BindFlags` in their description that has the `BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE` bit set. Use the `GraphicsDevice::BindResource()` function to bind a single shader resource, or the `GraphicsDevice::BindResources()` to bind a bundle of shader resources, occupying a number of slots starting from the bind slot. Use the `GraphicsDevice::UnbindResources()` function to unbind several shader resource slots manually, which is useful for removing debug device warnings.
- UAV<br/>
Unordered Access Views, in other words resources with read-write access. `GPUBuffer`s and `Texture`s can be bound as shader resources if they were created with a `BindFlags` in their description that has the `BIND_UNORDERED_ACCESS` bit set. Use the `GraphicsDevice::BindUAV()` function to bind a single UAV resource, or the `GraphicsDevice::BindUAVs()` to bind a bundle of UAV resources, occupying a number of slots starting from the bind slot. Use the `GraphicsDevice::UnbindUAVs()` function to unbind several UAV slots manually, which is useful for removing debug device warnings.
- Constant buffers<br/>
Only `GPUBuffer`s can be set as constant buffers if they were created with a `BindFlags` in their description that has the `BIND_CONSTANT_BUFFER` bit set. The resource can't be a constant buffer at the same time when it is also a shader resource or a UAV or a vertex buffer or an index buffer. Use the `GraphicsDevice::BindConstantBuffer()` function to bind constant buffers.
- Samplers<br/>
Only `Sampler` can be bound as sampler. Use the `GraphicsDevice::BindSampler()` function to bind samplers. Additionally, you can specify auto samplers and common samplers and avoid binding them every time.

There are some limitations on the maximum value of slots that can be used, these are defined as compile time constants in [Graphics device SharedInternals](../WickedEngine/wiGraphicsDevice_SharedInternals.h). The user can modify these and recompile the engine if the predefined slots are not enough. This could slightly affect performance.

Remarks:
- Vulkan and DX12 devices make an effort to combine descriptors across shader stages, so overlapping descriptors will not be supported with those APIs to some extent. For example it is OK, to have a constant buffer on slot 0 (b0) in a vertex shader while having a Texture2D on slot 0 (t0) in pixel shader. However, having a StructuredBuffer on vertex shader slot 0 (t0) and a Texture2D in pixel shader slot 0 (t0) will not work correctly, as only one of them will be bound to a pipeline state. This is made for performance reasons and to retain compatibility with the [advanced binding model](#resource-binding-advanced).
- Auto samplers can be added to `Shader`s. These sasmplers will always be bound to the shader stage as static samplers. The user doesn't need to use `BindSampler()` function for these.
- Common Samplers can be set on the graphics device. These samplers will be bound to all shaders that are created after the common sampler have been set. The user doesn't need to use `BindSampler()` function for these.

##### Resource Binding (Advanced)
This resource binding model is based on a combination of DirectX 12 and Vulkan resource binding model and allows the developer to use a more fine grained resource management that can be fitted for specific use cases more optimally. For example, a bindless descriptor model could be implemented with descriptor arrays, or a system where descriptors are grouped by update frequency into tables. The developer can query whether the `GraphicsDevice` supports advanced binding model, by querying the `GRAPHICSDEVICE_CAPABILITY_DESCRIPTOR_MANAGEMENT` capability with `GraphicsDevice::CheckCapability()`.

The following APIs are available:

- `ResourceRange`: Represents an array of descriptors, by specifying the descriptor type (any GPUResource type that is declared within a shader), the binding slot and the number of descriptors in the array.
- `SamplerRange`: Represents an array of samplers, by specifying the binding slot and the number of sampler desciptors in the array.
- `StaticSampler`: Represents a static sampler by specifying the sampler description and bind point. Static sampler array is not permitted. The static samplers are samplers that never change and they can result in more efficient shader code being generated.
- `RootConstantRange`: Root constants are a group of 32 bit values that will be used by a shader without going through a real descriptor, so the access indirfection count is zero, which can make them most efficient to use. However, they take a lot of space from the root signature, so it is advised to use them sparingly. Bounds checking is also not supported on these, so careless use could result in GPU hang.
- `DescriptorTable`: Descriptors are always grouped within tables. The implementation can remove descriptors from tables and put them into the root of the `RootSignature` if the `ResourceRange` is either `ROOT_CONSTANTBUFFER`, `ROOT_RAWBUFFER`, `ROOT_RWRAWBUFFER`, `ROOT_STRUCTUREDBUFFER` or `ROOT_RWSTRUCTUREDBUFFER`. Root descriptors take additional space in the `RootSignature`, so use them sparingly. Bounds checking is also not supported on root descriptors, so careless use could result in GPU hang.
- `RootSignature`: This can contain a number of `DescriptorTable`s, `RootConstantRange`s and `StaticSampler`s. `Shader`s, `PipelineState`s and `RaytracingPipelineState` objects can declare that they are using a root signature and by doing so, they will switch to the advanced resource binding model. Specify the `RootSignature::FLAG_ALLOW_INPUT_ASSEMBLER_INPUT_LAYOUT` flag if this is going to be used by a graphics `PipelineState` object.
- `CreateDescriptorTable()`: Create the underlying GPU resources for the `DescriptorTable`.
- `CreteRootSignature()`: Create the underlying GPU resources for the `RootSignature`
- `WriteDescriptor()`: Write actual descriptors into the table (either `GPUResource` or `Sampler`). To write individual `subresource`s, refer to the [Subresources](#subresources) topic. The indexing of the descriptors will match by what order they are declared withing the tables. Root descriptors don't have to be written by this function.
- `BindDescriptorTable()`: The `DescriptorTable` will be bound to either `GRAPHICS`, `COMPUTE` or `RAYTRACING` pipelines to the specified `space`. The HLSL shader code can declare `space` registers manually, but the default `space` will be `0`. To declare `space` manually, use the `register` keyword like this: `register(t56, space4)` (which would mean slot=56 in descriptor space=4.
- `BindRootDescriptor()`: Bind the root descriptor to the specified slot in the root signature. The slot is calculated by taking the index of the root descriptor relative to all root descriptors bound to the root signature (within all tables). This must be done after using `BindDescriptorTable()` to first bind the table itself (because Vulkan API will put the root descriptors within the table). After `BindDescriptorTable()` is called, all root descriptors will need to be rebound.
- `BindRootConstants()`: Write into the specified `RootConstantRange` directly. The index is relative to the array of `RootConstantRange`s declared inside the `RootSignature`.

##### Subresources
Resources like textures can have different views. For example, if a texture contains multiple mip levels, each mip level can be viewed as a separate texture with one mip level, or the whole texture can be viewed as a texture with multiple mip levels. When creating resources, a subresource that views the entire resource will be created. Functions that expect a subresource parameter can be provided with the value `-1` that means the whole resource. Usually, this parameter is optional.

Other subresources can be create with the `GraphicsDevice::CreateSubresource()` function. The function will return an `int` value that can be used to refer to the subresource view that was created. In case the function returns `-1`, the subresource creation failed due to an incorrect parameter. Please use the [debug device](#debug-device) functionality to check for errors in this case.

##### Pipeline States and Shaders
`PipelineState`s are used to define the graphics pipeline state, that includes which shaders are used, which blend mode, rasterizer state, input layout, depth stencil state and primitive topology, as well as sample mask are in effect. These states can only be bound atomically in a single call to `GraphicsDevice::SetPipelineState()`. This does not include compute shaders, which do not participate in the graphics pipeline state and can be bound individually using `GraphicsDevice::BindComputeShader()` method.

The pipeline states are subject to shader compilations. Shader compilation will happen when a pipeline state is bound inside a render pass for the first time. This is required because the render target formats are necessary information for compilation, but they are not part of the pipeline state description. This choice was made for increased flexibility of defining pipeline states. However, unlike APIs where state subsets (like RasterizerDesc, or BlendStateDesc) can be bound individually, the grouping of states is more optimal regarding CPU time, because state hashes are computed only once for the whole pipeline state at creation time, as opposed to binding time for each individual state. This approach is also less prone to user error when the developer might forget setting any subset of state and the leftover state from previous render passes are incorrect. 

Shaders still need to be created with `GraphicsDevice::CreateShader()` in a similar to CreateTexture(), etc. This could result in shader compilation/hashing in some graphics APIs like DirectX 11. The CreateShader() function expects a `wiGraphics::SHADERSTAGE` enum value which will define the type of shader:

- `MS`: Mesh Shader
- `AS`: Amplification Shader, or Task Shader
- `VS`: Vertex Shader
- `HS`: Hull Shader, or Tessellation Control Shader
- `DS`: Domain Shader, or Tessellation Evaluation Shader
- `GS`: Geometry Shader
- `PS`: Pixel Shader
- `CS`: Compute Shader
- `LIB`: Library shader
- `SHADERSTAGE_COUNT`: Invalid Shader. This can be used to enumerate through all shader stages like:

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < SHADERSTAGE_COUNT; ++i)
{
	device->BindResource((SHADERSTAGE)i, myTexture, 5, cmd); // Binds myTexture to slot 5 for all stages
}
```

Depending on the graphics device implementation, the shader code must be different format. For example, DirectX expects HLSL shaders, Vulkan expects SPIR-V shaders. The engine can only use precompiled shader bytecodes, shader compilation from high level source code is not supported. Usually shaders are compiled into bytecode and saved to files (with .cso extension) by Visual Studio if they are included in the project. These files can be loaded to memory and provided as input buffers to the CreateShader() function.

##### Render Passes
Render passes are defining regions in GPU execution where a number of render targets or depth buffers will be used to render into them. Render targets and depth buffers are defined as `RenderPassAttachment`s. The `RenderPassAttachment`s have a pointer to the texture, state the resource type (`RENDERTARGET`, `DEPTH_STENCIL` or `RESOLVE`), state the [subresource](#subresources) index, the load and store operations, and the layout transitions for the textures.

- `RENDERTARGET`: The attachment will be used as a (color) render target. The order of these attachments define the shader color output order.
- `DEPTH_STENCIL`: The attachment will be used as a depth (and/or stencil) buffer.
- `RESOLVE`: The attachment will be used as MSAA resolve destination. The resolve source is chosen among the `RENDERTARGET` attachments in the same render pass, in the order they were declared in. The declaration order of the `RENDERTARGET` and `RESOLVE` attachment must match to correctly deduce source and destination targets for resolve operations.

- Load Operation: <br/>
Defines how the texture contents are initialized at the start of the render pass. `LOADOP_LOAD` says that the previous texture content will be retained. `LOADOP_CLEAR` says that the previous contents of the texture will be lost and instead the texture clear color will be used to fill the texture. `LOADOP_DONTCARE` says that the texture contents are undefined, so this should only be used when the developer can ensure that the whole texture will be rendered to and not leaving any region empty (in which case, undefined results will be present in the texture).
- Store operation: <br/>
Defines how the texture contents are handled after the render pass ends. `STOREOP_STORE` means that the contents will be preserved. `STOREOP_DONTCARE` means that the contents won't be necessarily preserved, they are only temporarily valid within the duration of the render pass, which can save some memory bandwidth on some platforms (specifically tile based rendering architectures, like mobile GPUs).
- Layout transition: <br/>
Define the `intial_layout`, `subpass_layout` (only for `RENDERTARGET` or `DEPTH_STENCIL`) and `final_layout` members to have an implicit transition performed as part of the render pass, that works like an [IMAGE_BARRIER](#gpu-barriers), but can be more optimal. The `initial_layout` states the starting state of the resource. The resource will be transitioned from `initial_layout` to `subpass_layout` within the render pass. The `subpass_layout` states how the resource is accessed within the render pass. For `RENDERTARGET`, this must be `IMAGE_LAYOUT_RENDERTARGET`, for `DEPTH_STENCIL` type, it must be either `IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTHSTENCIL` or `IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTHSTENCIL_READONLY`. For `RESOLVE` type, the subpass_layout have no meaning, it is implicitly defined. At the end of the render pass, the resources will be transitioned from `subpass_layout` to `final_layout`.

Notes:
- When `RenderPassBegin()` is called, `RenderPassEnd()` must be called after on the same command list before the command list gets [submitted](#work-submission).
- It is not allowed to call `CopyResource()`, `CopyTexture2D()`, etc. inside a render pass.
- It is not allowed to call `Dispatch()` and `DispatchIndirect()` inside a render pass.
- It is not allowed to call `UpdateBuffer()` inside the render pass unless the buffer is `USAGE_DYNAMIC` and is a `BIND_CONSTANT_BUFFER`.

##### GPU Barriers
`GPUBarrier`s can be used to state dependencies between GPU workloads. There are different kinds of barriers:

- MEMORY_BARRIER <br/>
Memory barriers are used to wait for UAV writes to finish, or in other words to wait for shaders to finish that are writing to a BIND_UNORDERED_ACCESS resource. The `GPUBarrier::memory.resource` member is a pointer to the GPUResource to wait on. If it is nullptr, than the barrier means "wait for every UAV write that is in flight to finish".
- IMAGE_BARRIER <br/>
Image barriers are stating resource state transition for [textures](#textures). The most common use case for example is to transition from `IMAGE_LAYOUT_RENDERTARGET` to `IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_RESOURCE`, which means that the [RenderPass](#render-passes) that writes to the texture as render target must finish before the barrier, and the texture can be used as a read only shader resource after the barrier. There are other cases that can be indicated using the `GPUBarrier::image.layout_before` and `GPUBarrier::image.layout_after` states. The `GPUBarrier::image.resource` is a pointer to the resource which will have its state changed. If the texture's `layout` (as part of the TextureDesc) is not `IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_RESOURCE`, the layout must be transitioned to `IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_RESOURCE` before binding as shader resource. The image layout can also be transitioned using a [RenderPass](#render-passes), which should be preferred to `GPUBarrier`s.
- BUFFER_BARRIER <br/>
Similar to `IMAGE_BARRIER`, but for [GPU Buffer](#gpu-buffers) state transitions.

It is very important to place barriers to the right places if using low level graphics devices APIs like [DirectX 12](#graphicsdevice_dx12) or [Vulkan](#graphicsdevice_vulkan). Missing a barrier could lead to corruption of rendered results, crashes and generally undefined behaviour. However, barriers don't have an effect for [DirectX 11](#graphicsdevice_dx11), they are handled automatically. The [debug layer](#debug-device) will help to detect errors and missing barriers.

##### Textures
`Texture` type resources are used to store images which will be sampled or written by the GPU efficiently. There are a lot of texture types, such as `Texture1D`, `Texture2D`, `TextureCube`, `Texture3D`, etc. used in [shaders](#shaders), that correspond to the simple `Texture` type on the CPU. The texture type will be determined when creating the resource with `GraphicsDevice::CreateTexture(const TextureDesc*, const SubresourceData*, Texture*)` function. The first argument is the `TextureDesc` that determines the dimensions, size, format and other properties of the texture resource. The `SubresourceData` is used to initialize the texture contents, it can be left as `nullptr`, when the texture contents don't need to be initialized, such as for textures that will be rendered into. The `Texture` is the texture that will be initialized.

`SubresourceData` usage: 
- The `SubresourceData` parameter points to an array of `SubresourceData` structs. The array size is determined by the `TextureDesc::ArraySize` * `TextureDesc::MipLevels`, so one structure for every subresource. 
- The `SubresourceData::pSysMem` pointer should point to the texture contents on the CPU that will be uploaded to the GPU.
- The `SubresourceData::SysMemPitch` member is indicating the distance (in bytes) from the beginning of one line of a texture to the next line.
System-memory pitch is used only for 2D and 3D texture data as it is has no meaning for the other resource types. Specify the distance from the first pixel of one 2D slice of a 3D texture to the first pixel of the next 2D slice in that texture in the `SysMemSlicePitch` member.
- The `SubresourcData::SysMemSlicePitch` member is indicating the distance (in bytes) from the beginning of one depth level to the next.
System-memory-slice pitch is only used for 3D texture data as it has no meaning for the other resource types.
- For more complete information, refer to the [DirectX 11 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_subresource_data) on this topic, which should closely match.

##### GPU Buffers
`GPUBuffer` type resources are used to store linear data which will be read or written by the GPU. There are a lot of buffer types, such as structured buffers, raw buffers, vertex buffers, index buffers, typed buffers, etc. used in [shaders](#shaders), that correspond to the simple `GPUBuffer` type on the CPU. The buffer type will be determined when creating the buffer with `GraphicsDevice::CreateBuffer(const GPUBufferDesc*, const SubresourceData*, GPUBuffer*)` function. The first argument is the `GPUBufferDesc` that determines the dimensions, size, format and other properties of the texture resource. The `SubresourceData` is used to initialize the texture contents, it can be left as `nullptr`, when the texture contents don't need to be initialized, such as for textures that will be rendered into. The `GPUBuffer` is the texture that will be initialized.

`SubresourceData` usage: 
- The `SubresourceData::pSysMem` pointer should point to the buffer contents on the CPU that will be uploaded to the GPU Buffer. The size of the data is determined by the `GPUBufferDesc::ByteWidth` value that was passed to the `GraphicsDevice::CreateBuffer()` function. The buffer contents will be readily available by the time the GPU first accesses the buffer.

Related topics: [Creating Resources](#creating-resources), [Destroying Resources](#destroying-resources), [Binding resources](#resource-binding), [Subresources](#subresources), [Updating GPU Buffers](#updating-gpu-buffers)

##### Updating GPU buffers
A common scenario is updating buffers, when the developer wants to make data visible from the CPU to the GPU. The simplest way is to use the `GraphicsDevice::UpdateBuffer()` function. To use this successfully, the buffer must have been created with a `Usage` that is either `USAGE_DEFAULT` or `USAGE_DYNAMIC`. The `USAGE_IMMUTABLE` buffers cannot be updated after having been created. If the `USAGE_DEFAULT` is in effect, the buffer updating can be heavier on the CPU, and introduce additional [GPUBarriers](#gpu-barriers), but they can have superior GPU read performance, or can be writable by the GPU. On the other hand, `USAGE_DYNAMIC` type buffers will be lighter weight on the CPU side, but they could have worse GPU performance. If `USAGE_DYNAMIC` was specified, the buffer must also have been created with `CPUAccessFlags` member of the `GPUBufferDesc` that contains the value `CPU_ACCESS_WRITE` in order to be successfully updated. 

`GraphicsDevice::UpdateBuffer()` function can either take the dataSize parameter, or if it is left as default, the `GPUBufferDesc::ByteWidth` (that was specified at buffer creation time) number of bytes will be read from the `data` parameter and uploaded to the buffer.

An other case is to dynamically allocate a temporary buffer using the `GraphicsDevice::AllocateGPU()` function. The developer has to specify the amount of space that needs to be allocated, and the function will return a `GPUAllocation` struct that has a `buffer` member that can be used for [resource binding](#resource-binding), a `data` pointer member that the application can write into, and an offset value, that indicates an offset that the new data will start from in the temporary buffer. Buffers that were allocated like this can be only used as index buffers, vertex buffers, instance buffers, or raw buffers. Attempting to use these as constant buffers, structured buffers, or typed buffers is not supported.

##### GPU Queries
The `GPUQuery` can be used to get information from the GPU to the CPU. The GPUQuery can be created for different purposes:
- `GPU_QUERY_TYPE_EVENT` query whether the GPU reached this point or not. Use with `GraphicsDevice::QueryEnd()` to issue. When the query is read, the result of the `GraphicsDevice::QueryRead()` will be either true or false depending on whether the GPU reached that point or not.
- `GPU_QUERY_TYPE_OCCLUSION` query how many pixels have been rendered by a range of draw calls. Use with `GraphicsDevice::QueryBegin()` and `GraphicsDevice::QueryEnd()` to mark a range of draw calls to check. When the results are retrieved, the number of rendered samples will be written to `GPUQueryResult::result_passed_sample_count`.
- `GPU_QUERY_TYPE_OCCLUSION_PREDICATE` query whether any pixels have been rendered by a range of draw calls. Use with `GraphicsDevice::QueryBegin()` and `GraphicsDevice::QueryEnd()` to mark a range of draw calls to check. When the results are retrieved, either `1` or `0` will be written to `GPUQueryResult::result_passed_sample_count`, depending on whether there were any rendered samples or not.
- `GPU_QUERY_TYPE_TIMESTAMP` store a timestamp when the GPU reaches this point. Use with `GraphicsDevice::QueryEnd()` to issue. When the results are retrieved, the timestamp will be written to `GPUQueryResult::result_timestamp`.
- `GPU_QUERY_TYPE_TIMESTAMP_DISJOINT` store the GPU clock frequency at this point. Use with `GraphicsDevice::QueryEnd()` to issue. When the results are retrieved, the timestamp will be written to `GPUQueryResult::result_timestamp_frequency`. The frequency can be used to retrieve time values from timestamps like this: 
```cpp
float time_range_milliseconds = float(b.result_timestamp - a.result_timestamp) / disjoint_result.result_timestamp_frequency * 1000.0f);
```

Use the `GraphicsDevice::QueryRead()` function to retrieve results. However, note that the GPU Queries are designed to be running on the GPU timeline, so they shouldn't be read by the CPU immediately, but only after some frames of latency. The `wiRenderer::GPUQueryRing` helper can be used for this purpose.

##### RayTracingAccelerationStructure
The acceleration strucuture can be bottom level or top level, and decided by the description strucutre's `type` field. Depending on the `type`, either the `toplevel` or `bottomlevel` member must be filled out before creating the acceleration structure. When creating the acceleration structure with the grpahics device (`GraphicsDevice::CreateRaytracingAccelerationStructure()`), sufficient backing memory is allocated, but the acceleration structure is not built. Building the acceleration structure is performed on the GPU timeline, via the `GraphicsDevice::BuildRaytracingAccelerationStructure()`. To build it from scratch, leave the `src` argument of this function to `nullptr`. To update the acceleration structure without doing a full rebuild, specify a `src` argument. The `src` can be the same acceleration structure, in this case the update will be performed in place. To be able to update an acceleration structure, it must have been created with the `RaytracingAccelerationStructureDesc::FLAG_ALLOW_UPDATE` flag.

##### RayTracingPipelineState
Binding a ray tracing pipeline state is required to dispatch ray tracing shaders. A ray tracing pipeline state holds a collection of shader libraries and hitgroup definitions. It also declares information about max resource usage of the pipeline.

##### Variable Rate Shading
Variable Rate Shading can be used to decrease shading quality while retaining depth testing accuracy. The shading rate can be set up in different ways:

- `BindShadingRate()`: Set the shading rate for the following draw calls. The first parameter is the shading rate, which is by default `SHADING_RATE_1X1` (the best quality). The increasing enum values are standing for decreasing shading rates.
- Shading rate image: Set the shading rate for the screen via a tiled texture. The texture must be set as a RenderPassAttachment of `SHADING_RATE_SOURCE` type. The texture must be using the `FORMAT_R8_UINT` format. In each pixel, the texture contains the shading rate value for a tile of pixels (8x8, 16x16 or 32x32). The tile size can be queried via `GetVariableRateShadingTileSize()`. The shading rate values that the texture contains are not the raw values from `SHADING_RATE` enum, but they must be converted to values that are native to the graphics API used using the `WriteShadingRateValue()` function. The shading rate texture must be written with a compute shader and transitioned to `IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADING_RATE_SOURCE` with a [GPUBarrier](#gpu-barriers) before setting it with `BindShadingRateImage()`. It is valid to set a `nullptr` instead of the texture, indicating that the shading rate is not specified by a texture.
- Or setting the shading rate from a vertex or geometry shader with the `SV_ShadingRate` system value semantic.

The final shading rate will be determined from the above methods using the maximum shading rate (least detailed) which is applicable to the screen tile. In the future it might be considered to expose the operator to define this.

### wiRenderer
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiRenderer.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiRenderer.cpp)
This is a collection of graphics technique implentations and functions to draw a scene, shadows, post processes and other things. It is also the manager of the GraphicsDevice instance, and provides other helper functions to load shaders from files on disk.

Apart from graphics helper functions that are mostly independent of each other, the renderer also provides facilities to render a Scene. This can be done via the high level DrawScene, DrawSky, etc. functions. These don't set up render passes or viewports by themselves, but they expect that they are set up from outside. Most other render state will be handled internally, such as constant buffers, stencil, blendstate, etc.. Please see how the scene rendering functions are used in the High level interface RenderPath3D implementations (for example [RenderPath3D_TiledForward.cpp](../WickedEngine/RenderPath3D_TiledForward.cpp))

Other points of interest here are utility graphics functions, such as CopyTexture2D, GenerateMipChain, and the like, which provide customizable operations, such as border expand mode, Gaussian mipchain generation, and things that wouldn't be supported by a graphics API.

The renderer also hosts post process implementations. These functions are independent and have clear input/output parameters. They shouldn't rely on any other extra setup from outside.

Read about the different features of the renderer in more detail below:

#### DrawScene
Renders the scene from the camera's point of view that was specified as parameter. Only the objects withing the camera [Frustum](#frustum) will be rendered. The objects will be sorted from front-to back. This is an optimization to reduce overdraw, because for opaque objects, only the closest pixel to the camera will contribute to the rendered image. Pixels behind the frontmost pixel will be culled by the GPU using the depth buffer and not be rendered. The sorting is implemented with RenderQueue internally. The RenderQueue is responsible to sort objects by distance and mesh index, so instaced rendering (batching multiple drawable objects into one draw call) and front-to back sorting can both work together. 

The `renderPass` argument will specify what kind of render pass we are using and specifies shader complexity and rendering technique.
The `cmd` argument refers to a valid [CommandList](#work-submission)
The `flags` argument can contain various modifiers that determine what kind of objects to render, or what kind of other properties to take into account:

- `DRAWSCENE_OPAQUE`: Opaque object will be rendered
- `DRAWSCENE_TRANSPARENT`: Transparent objects will be rendered. Objects will be sorted back-to front, for blending purposes
- `DRAWSCENE_OCCLUSIONCULLING`: Occluded objects won't be rendered. [Occlusion culling](#occlusion-culling) can be globally switched on/off using `wiRenderer::SetOcclusionCullingEnabled()`
- `DRAWSCENE_TESSELLATION`: Enable [tessellation](#tessellation) (if hardware supports it). [Tessellation](#tessellation) can be globally switched on/off using `wiRenderer::SetTessellationEnabled()`
- `DRAWSCENE_HAIRPARTICLE`: Draw hair particles

#### Tessellation
Tessellation can be used when rendering objects. Tessellation requires a GPU hardware feature and can enable displacement mapping on vertices or smoothing mesh silhouettes dynamically while rendering objects. Tessellation will be used when `tessellation` parameter to the [DrawScene](#drawscene) was set to `true` and the GPU supports the tessellation feature. Tessellation level can be specified per [MeshComponent](#meshcomponent)'s `tessellationFactor` parameter. Tessellation level will be modulated by distance from camera, so that tessellation factor will fade out on more distant objects. Greater tessellation factor means more detailed geometry will be generated.

#### Occlusion Culling
Occlusion culling is a technique to determine which objects are within the camera, but are completely behind an other objects, such that they wouldn't be rendered. The depth buffer already does occlusion culling on the GPU, however, we would like to perform this earlier than submitting the mesh to the GPU for drawing, so essentially do the occlusion culling on CPU. A hybrid approach is used here, which uses the results from a previously rendered frame (that was rendered by GPU) to determine if an object will be visible in the current frame. For this, we first render the object into the previous frame's depth buffer, and use the previous frame's camera matrices, however, the current position of the object. In fact, we only render bounding boxes instead of objects, for performance reasons. Occlusion queries are used while rendering, and the CPU can read the results of the queries in a later frame. We keep track of how many frames the object was not visible, and if it was not visible for a certain amount, we omit it from rendering. If it suddenly becomes visible later, we immediately enable rendering it again. This technique means that results will lag behind for a few frames (latency between cpu and gpu and latency of using previous frame's depth buffer). These are implemented in the functions `wiRenderer::OcclusionCulling_Render()` and `wiRenderer::OcclusionCulling_Read()`. 

#### Shadow Maps
The `DrawShadowmaps()` function will render shadow maps for each active dynamic light that are within the camera [frustum](#frustum). There are two types of shadow maps, 2D and Cube shadow maps. The maximum number of usable shadow maps are set up with calling `SetShadowProps2D()` or `SetShadowPropsCube()` functions, where the parameters will specify the maximum number of shadow maps and resolution. The shadow slots for each light must be already assigned, because this is a rendering function and is not allowed to modify the state of the [Scene](#scene) and [lights](#lightcomponent). The shadow slots will be set up in the [UpdatePerFrameData()](#updateperframedata) function that is called every frame by the `RenderPath3D`.

#### UpdatePerFrameData
This function prepares the scene for rendering. It must be called once every frame. It will modify the [Scene](#scene) and other rendering related resources. It is called after the [Scene](#scene) was updated. It performs frustum culling and other management tasks, such as packing decal rects into atlas and several other things.

#### UpdateRenderData
Begin rendering the frame on GPU. This means that GPU compute jobs are kicked, such as particle simulations, texture packing, mipmap generation tasks that were queued up, updating per frame GPU buffer data, animation vertex skinning and other things.

#### Ray tracing (hardware accelerated)

Hardware accelerated ray tracing API is now available, so a variety of renderer features are available using that. If the hardware support is available, the `Scene` will allocate a top level acceleration structure, and the meshes will allocate bottom level acceleration structures for themselves. Updating these is done by simply calling `wiRenderer::UpdateRaytracingAccelerationStructures(cmd)`. The updates will happen on the GPU timeline, so provide a [CommandList](#work-submission) as argument. The top level acceleration structure will be rebuilt from scratch. The bottom level acceleration structures will be rebuilt from scratch once, and then they will be updated (refitted).

After the acceleration structures are updated, ray tracing shaders can use it after binding to a shader resource slot.

#### Ray tracing (legacy)
Ray tracing can be used in multiple ways to render the scene. The `RayTraceScene()` function will render the scene with the rays that are provided as the `RayBuffers` type argument. For example, to render the scene from the camera perspective, first create rays that originate from the camera and shoot towards the caera far plane for every pixel. The `GenerateScreenRayBuffers()` helper function implements this functionality, by expecting a [CameraComponent](#cameracomponent) argument and returns a `RayBuffers` structure. The result will be written to a texture that is provided as parameter. The texture must have been created with `BIND_UNORDERED_ACCESS` bind flags, because it will be written in compute shaders. The scene BVH structure must have been already built to use this, it can be accomplished by calling [wiRenderer::BuildSceneBVH()](#build-scene-bvh). The [RenderPath3D_Pathracing](#renderpath3d_pathtracing) uses this ray tracing functionality to render a path traced scene.

Other than path tracing, the scene BVH can be rendered by using the `RayTraceSceneBVH` function. This will render the bounding box hierarchy to the screen as a heatmap. Blue colors mean that few boxes were hit per pixel, and with more bounding box hits the colors go to green, yellow, red, and finaly white. This is useful to determine how expensive a the scene is with regards to ray tracing performance.

The lightmap baking is also using ray tracing on the GPU to precompute static lighting for objects in the scene. [Objects](#objectcomponent) that contain lightmap atlas texture coordinate set can start lightmap rendering by setting `ObjectComponent::SetLightmapRenderRequest(true)`. Every object that have this flag set will have their lightmaps updated by performing ray traced rendering by the [wiRenderer](#wirenderer) internally. Lightmap texture coordinates can be generated by a separate tool, such as the Wicked Engine Editor application. Lightmaps will be rendered to a global lightmap atlas that can be used by all shaders to read static lighting data. The global lightmap atlas texture contains lightmaps from all objects inside the scene in a compact format for performance. Apart from that, each object contains its own lightmap in a full precision texture format that can be post-processed and saved to disc for later use.

#### Scene BVH
The scene BVH can be rebuilt from scratch using the `wiRenderer::BuildSceneBVH()` function. This will use the global scene to build the BVH hierarchy and global material atlases. The [ray tracing](#ray-tracing) features require the scene BVH to be built before using them. This is using the [wiGPUBVH](#wigpubvh) facility to build the BVH using compute shaders running on the GPU. 

#### Decals
The [DecalComponents](#decalcomponent) in the scene can be rendered differently based on the rendering technique that is being used. The two main rendering techinques are forward and deferred rendering. 

<b>Forward rendering</b> is aimed at low bandwidth consumption, so the scene lighting is computed in one rendering pass, right when rendering the scene objects to the screen. In this case, all of the decals are also processed in the object rendering shaders automatically. In this case a decal atlas will need to be generated, because all decal textures must be available to sample in a single shader, but this is handled automatically inside the [UpdateRenderData](#updaterenderdata) function.

<b>Deferred rendering</b> techniques are outputting G-buffers, and compute lighting in a separate pass that is decoupled from the object rendering pass. Decals are rendered one by one on top of the albedo buffer using the function `wiRenderer::DrawDeferredDecals()`. All the lighting will be computed on top after the decals were rendered to the albedo in a separate render pass to complete the final scene.

#### Environment probes
[EnvironmentProbeComponents](#environmentprobecomponent) can be placed into the scene and if they are tagged as invalid using the `EnvironmentProbeComponent::SetDirty(true)` flag, they will be rendered to a cubemap array that is accessible in all shaders. They will also be rendered in real time every frame if the `EnvironmentProbeComponent::SetRealTime(true)` flag is set. The cubemaps of these contain indirect specular information from a point source that can be used as approximate reflections for close by objects.

The probes also must have [TransformComponent](#transformcomponent) associated to the same entity. This will be used to position the probes in the scene, but also to scale and rotate them. The scale/position/rotation defines an oriented bounding box (OBB) that will be used to perform parallax corrected environment mapping. This means that reflections inside the box volume will not appear as infinitely distant, but constrained inside the volume, to achieve more believable illusion.

#### Post processing
There are several post processing effects implemented in the `wiRenderer`. They are all implemented in a single function with their name starting with Postprocess_, like for example: `wiRenderer::Postprocess_SSAO()`. They are aimed to be stateless functions, with their function signature clearly indicating input-output parameters and resources.

The chain/order of post processes is not implemented here, only the single effects themselves. The order of post proceses is more of a user responsibility, so it should be implemented in the [High Ievel Interface](#high-level-interface). For reference, a default post processchain is implemented in [RenderPath3D::RenderPostProcessChain()](#renderpath3d) function.

#### Instancing
Instanced rendering will be always used automatically when rendering objects. This means, that [ObjectComponents](#objectcomponent) that share the same [mesh](#meshcomponent) will be batched together into a single draw call, even if they have different transformations, colors, or dithering parameters. This can greatly reduce CPU overhead when lots of objects are duplicated (for example trees, rocks, props).

[ObjectComponents](#objectcomponent) can override [stencil](#stencil) settings for the [material](#materialcomponent). In case multiple [ObjectComponents](#objectcomponent) share the same mesh, but some are using different stencil overrides, those could be removed from the instanced batch, so there is some overhead to modifying stencil overrides for objects.

<i>Tip: to find out more about how instancing is used to batch objects together, take a look at the `RenderMeshes()` function inside [wiRenderer.cpp](../WickedEngine/wiRenderer.cpp)</i>

#### Stencil
If a depth stencil buffer is bound when using [DrawScene()](#drawscene), or [DrawScene_Transparent()](#drawscene_transparent), the stencil buffer will be written. The stencil is a 8-bit mask that can be used to achieve different kinds of screen space effects for different objects. [MaterialComponents](#materialcomponent) and [ObjectComponents](#objectcomponent) have the ability to set the stencil value that will be rendered. The 8-bit stencil value is separated into two parts:
- The first 4 bits are reseved for engine-specific values, such as to separate skin, sky, common materials from each other. these values are contained in [wiEnums](#wienums) in the `STENCILREF` enum.
- The last 4 bits are reserved for user stencil values. The application can decide what it wants to use these for.

Please use the `wiRenderer::CombineStencilrefs()` function to specify stencil masks in a future-proof way.

The [Pipeline States](#pipeline-states) have a `DepthStencilState` type member which will control how the stencil mask is used in the graphics pipeline for any custom rendering effect. The functionality is supposed to be equivalent and closely matching of what DirectX 11 provides, so for further information, refer to the [DirectX 11 documentation of Depth Stencil States](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-depth-stencil).

#### Loading Shaders
While the [GraphicsDevice is responsible of creating shaders and pipeline states](#pipeline-states-and-shaders), loading the shader files themselves are not handled by the graphics device. The `wiRenderer::LoadShader()` is a helper function that provides this feature. This is internally loading shaders from a common shader path, that is by default the "../WickedEngine/shaders" directory (relative to the application working directory), so the filename provided to this function must be relative to that path. Every system in the engine that loads shaders uses this function to load shaders from the same folder, which makes it very easy to reload shaders on demand with the `wiRenderer::ReloadShaders()` function. This is useful for when the developer modifies a shader and recompiles it, the engine can reload it while the application is running. The developer can modify the common shader path with the `wiRenderer::SetShaderPath()` to any path of preference. The developer is free to load shaders with a custom loader, from any path too, but the `wiRenderer::ReloadShaders()` functionality might not work in that case for those shaders.

#### Debug Draw
Debug geometry can be rendered by calling the `wiRenderer::DrawDebugWorld()` function and setting up debug geometries, or enabling debug features. The `DrawDebugWorld()` is already called by [RenderPath3D](#renderpath3d), so the developer can simply just worry about configure debug drawing features and add debug geometries and drawing will happen at the right place (if the developer decided to use [RenderPath3D](#renderpath3d) in their application). 

The user provided debug geometry features at present are: 
- `DrawBox()`: provide a transformation matrix and color to render a wireframe box mesh with the desired transformation and color. The box will be only rendered for a single frame.
- `DrawLine()`: provide line segment begin, end positions and a color value. The line will be only rendered for a single frame.
- `DrawPoint()`: provide a position, size and color to render a point as a "X" line geometry that is always camera facing. The point will be only rendered for a single frame.
- `DrawTriangle()`: provide 3 positions and colors that represent a colored triangle. There is an option to draw the triangle in wireframe mode instead of solid. The triangle will be only rendered for a single frame.
- `DrawSphere()`: provide a sphere and a color, its bounds will be drawn as line geometry. The sphere will be only rendered for a single frame.
- `DrawCapsule()`: provide a capsule and a color, its bounds will be drawn as line geometry. The capsule will be only rendered for a single frame.

Configuring other debug rendering functionality:
- `SetToDrawDebugBoneLines()`: Bones will be rendered as lines
- `SetToDrawDebugPartitionTree()`: Scene object bounding boxes will be rendered.
- `SetToDrawDebugEnvProbes()`: Environment probes will be rendered as reflective spheres and their affection range as oriented bounding boxes.
- `SetToDrawDebugEmitters()`: Emitter mesh geometries will be rendered as wireframe meshes.
- `SetToDrawDebugForceFields()`: Force field volumes will be rendered.
- `SetToDrawDebugCameras()`: Cameras will be rendered as oriented boxes.

#### Animation Skinning
[MeshComponents](#meshcomponent) that have their `armatureID` associated with an [ArmatureComponent](#armaturecomponent) will be skinned inside the `wiRenderer::UpdateRenderData()` function. This means that their vertex buffer will be animated with compute shaders, and the animated vertex buffer will be used throughout the rest of the frame. 

If the [ArmatureComponent](#armaturecomponent) has less than `SKINNING_COMPUTE_THREADCOUNT` amount of bones, an optimized version of the skinning will be performed that uses shared memory. The user can disable this with the `wiRenderer::SetLDSSkinningEnabled()` function if the optimization proves to be worse on the target platform.

#### Custom Shaders
Apart from the built in material shaders, the developer can create a library of custom shaders from the application side and assign them to materials. The `wiRenderer::RegisterCustomShader()` function is used to register a custom shader from the application. The function returns the ID of the custom shader that can be input to the `MaterialComponent::SetCustomShaderID()` function. 

The custom shader is essentially the combination of a [Pipeline State Object](#pipeline-states-and-shaders) for each `RENDERPASS` and a `RENDERTYPE` flag that specifies whether it is to be drawn in a transparent or opaque, or other kind of pass within a `RENDERPASS`. The developer is responsible of creating a fully valid pipeline state to render a mesh. If a pipeline state is left as empty for a combination of `RENDERPASS` and `RENDERTYPE`, then the material will simply be skipped and not rendered.


### wiEnums
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiEnums.h)
This is a collection of enum values used by the wiRenderer to identify graphics resources. Usually arrays of the same resource type are declared and the XYZENUM_COUNT values tell the length of the array. The other XYZENUM_VALUE represents a single element within that array. This makes the code easy to manage, for example:

```cpp
enum CBTYPE
{
	CBTYPE_MESH, // = 0
	CBTYPE_APPLESANDORANGES, // = 1
	CBTYPE_TAKEITEASY, // = 2
	CBTYPE_COUNT // = 3
};
GPUBuffer buffers[CBTYPE_COUNT]; // this example array contains 3 elements
//...
device->BindConstantBuffer(PS, &buffers[CBTYPE_MESH], 0, cmd); // makes it easy to reference an element
```

This is widely used to make code straight forward and easy to add new objects, without needing to create additional declarations, except for the enum values.

```
The example will draw a 2D texture image to the position (10, 20), with a size of 256 x 128 pixels to the screen (or the curernt render pass). There are a lot of other parameters to customize the rendered image, for more information see wiImageParams structure.

## Helpers
A collection of engine-level helper classes

### wiAllocators
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiAllocators.h)

#### LinearAllocator
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiAllocators.h)
The linear allocator is used to allocate contiguous blocks of memory. The amount of maximum allocations is defined at creation time.

### wiArchive
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiArchive.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiArchive.cpp)
This is used for serializing binary data to disk or memory. An archive file always starts with the 64-bit version number that it was serialized with. An archive of greater version number than the current archive version of the engine can't be opened safely, so an error message will be shown if this happens. A certain archive version will not be forward compatible with the current engine version if the current archive version barrier number is greater than the archive's own version number.

### wiColor
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiColor.h)
Utility to convert to/from float color data to 32-bit RGBA data (stored in a uint32_t as RGBA, where each channel is 8 bits)

#### ThreadSafeRingBuffer
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiContainers.h)
This is a thread safe container that can hold elements of one certain data type at once. Elements are added to the end of container, and they are removed from the beginning. The container wraps around, so if the last element would be put after the last valid array index, then it will be put to the first instead (if the first array index is not occupied).

### wiFadeManager
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiFadeManager.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiFadeManager.cpp)
Simple helper to manage a fadeout screen. Fadeout starts at transparent, then fades smoothly to an opaque color (such as black, in most cases), then a callback occurs which the user can handle with their own event. After that, the color will fade back to transperent. This is used by the [MainComponent](#maincomponent) to fade from one RenderPath to an other.

This is the high level input interface. Use this to read input devices in a platform-independent way.
- Initialize <br/>
Creates all necessary resources, the engine initialization already does this via [wiInitializer](#wiinitializer), so the user probably doesn't have to worry about this.
- Update <br/>
This is called once per frame and necessary to process inputs. This is automatically called in [MainComponent](#maincomponent), so the user doesn't need to worry about it, unless they are reimplementing the high level interface for themselves.
- Down <br/>
Checks whether a button is currently held down.
- Press <br/>
Checks whether a button was pressed in the current frame.
- Hold <br/>
Checks whether a button was held down for a specified amount of time. It can be checked whether it was held down exactly for the set amount of time, or at least for that long.
- GetPointer <br/>
Returns the mouse position. The first two values of the returned vector are mouse pointer coordinates in window space. The third value is the relative scroll button difference since last frame.
- SetPointer <br/>
Sets the mouse pointer position in window-relative coordinates.
- HidePointer <br/>
Hides or shows the mouse pointer.
- GetAnalog <br/>
Returns the gamepad's analog position.
- SetControllerFeedback <br/>
Utilize various features of the gamepad, such as vibration, or LED color.

### BUTTON
This collection of enums containing all the usable digital buttons, either on keyboard or a controller. If you wish to specify a letter key on the keyboard, you can use the plain character value and cast to this enum, like:

```cpp
bool is_P_key_pressed = wiInput::Press((wiInput::BUTTON)'P');
```

### KeyboardState
The keyboard's full state, where each button's state is stored as either pressed or released. Can be queried via [wiRawInput](#wirawinput)

### MouseState
The mouse pointer's absolute and relative position. Can be queried via [wiRawInput](#wirawinput)

### ControllerState
The controller's button and analog states. Can be queried via [wiRawInput](#wirawinput) or [wiXInput](#wixinput)

### ControllerFeedback
The controller force feedback features that might be supported. Can be provided to [wiRawInput](#wirawinput) or [wiXInput](#wixinput)

## Physics
You can find the physics system related functionality under ENGINE/Physics filter in the solution.
It uses the entity-component system to perform updating all physics components in the world.
### wiPhysicsEngine
[[Header]](../WickedEngine/wiPhysicsEngine.h) [[Cpp]](../WickedEngine/wiPhysicsEngine.cpp)
- Initialize<br/>
This must be called before using the physics system, but it is automatically done by [wiInitializer](#wiinitializer)
- IsEnabled<br/>

- SetEnabled<br/>
Enable or disable physics system
- RunPhysicsUpdateSystem<br/>

#### Rigid Body Physics
Rigid body simulation requires [RigidBodyPhysicsComponent](#rigidbodyphysicscomponent) for entities and [TransformComponent](#transformcomponent). It will modify TransformComponents with physics simulation data, so after simulation, TransformComponents will contain absolute world matrix.

<b>Kinematic</b> rigid bodies are those that are not simulated by the physics system, but they will affect the rest of the simulation. For example, an animated kinematic rigid body will strictly follow the animation, but affect any other rigid bodies it comes in contact with. Set a rigid body to kinematic by having the `RigidBodyPhysicsComponent::KINEMATIC` flag in the `RigidBodyPhysicsComponent::_flags` bitmask.

<b>Deactivation</b> happens after a while for rigid bodies that participated in the simulation for a while, this means after that they will no longer participate in the simulation. This behaviour can be disabled with the `RigidBodyPhysicsComponent::DISABLE_DEACTIVATION` flag.

There are multiple <b>Collision Shapes</b> of rigid bodies that can be used:
- `BOX`: simple oriented bounding box, fast.
- `SPHERE`: simple sphere, fast.
- `CAPSULE`: Two spheres with a cylinder between them.
- `CONVEX_HULL`: A simplified mesh.
- `TRIANGLE_MESH`: The original mesh. It is always kinematic.

#### Soft Body Physics
Soft body simulation requires [SoftBodyPhysicsComponent](#softbodyphysicscomponent) for entities as well as [MeshComponent](#meshcomponent). When creating a soft body, the simulation mesh will be computed from the MeshComponent vertices and mapping tables from physics to graphics indices that associate graphics vertices with physics vertices. The physics vertices will be simulated in world space and copied to the `SoftBodyPhysicsComponent::vertex_positions_simulation` array as graphics vertices. This array can be uploaded as vertex buffer as is. 

The [ObjectComponent](#objectcomponent)'s transform matrix is used as a manipulation matrix to the soft body, if the ObjectComponent's mesh has a soft body associated with it. The manipulation matrix means, that pinned soft body physics vertices will receive that transformation matrix. The simulated vertices will follow those manipulated vertices.

<b>Pinning</b> the soft body vertices means that those physics vertices have zero weights, so they are not simulated, but instead drive the simulation, as in other vertices will follow them, a bit like how kinematic rigid bodies manipulate simulated rigid bodies.

The pinned vertices can also be manipulated via <b>skinning animation</b>. If the soft body mesh is skinned and an animation is playing, then the pinned vertices will follow the animation.

<b>Deactivation</b> happens after a while for soft bodies that participated in the simulation for a while, this means after that they will no longer participate in the simulation. This behaviour can be disabled with the `SoftBodyPhysicsComponent::DISABLE_DEACTIVATION` flag.

<b>Resetting</b> a soft body can be accomplished by setting the `SoftBodyPhysicsComponent::FORCE_RESET` flag. This means that the next physics update will reset the soft body mesh to the initial pose.

You can see them all in [ShaderInterop.h](../WickedEngine/ShaderInterop.h)

Note: When creating constant buffers, the structure must be strictly padded to 16-byte boundaries according to HLSL rules. Apart from that, the following limitation is in effect for Vulkan compatibility:

Incorrect padding to 16-byte:
```cpp
CBUFFER(cbuf, 0)
{
	float padding;
	float3 value; // <- the larger type can start a new 16-byte slot, so the C++ and shader side structures could mismatch
	float4 value2;
};
```

Correct padding:
```cpp
CBUFFER(cbuf, 0)
{
	float3 value; // <- the larger type must be placed before the padding
	float padding;
	float4 value2;
};
```
