Liberation Sans font: https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts

Digitized data copyright (c) 2010 Google Corporation
	with Reserved Font Arimo, Tinos and Cousine.
Copyright (c) 2012 Red Hat, Inc.
	with Reserved Font Name Liberation.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to
support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in
which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold
by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any
software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot
be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as
such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any
of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the
Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy,
merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by
itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software,
provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files
as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is
granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to
the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or
advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s)
or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and
must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK,
OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT
SOFTWARE.

Distributables. You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software
listed in the distributables file list in the software; and

Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to
copy and distribute any of this distributable code you elect to distribute with
your applications.

Distribution Requirements. For any code you distribute, you must:

add significant primary functionality to it in your applications; 

i.  require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect
it and Microsoft at least as much as this agreement; and

ii. indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including
attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except
to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified distributable
code.

Distribution Restrictions. You may not:

use Microsoft’s trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that
suggests your application comes from or is endorsed by Microsoft; or modify or
distribute the source code of any distributable code so that any part of it
becomes subject to any license that requires that the distributable code, any
other part of the software, or any of Microsoft’s other intellectual property
be disclosed or distributed in source code form, or that others have the right
to modify it.

SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all
other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use
it in certain ways;

reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt
to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by
third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that
may be included in the software;

remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in
the software;

use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate
malware; or

share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except for any distributable
code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a stand-alone
offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any
third party.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on
destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export
restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.

SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any
support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all
faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and
install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized
sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates.
You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice.
Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or
peripheral devices.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for
supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for
the software.

APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in
the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live
(or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims),
regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any
other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of
your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the
following provisions apply to you:

a.  Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
    Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect
    those rights.

b.  Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
    receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
    disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you
    re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume
    checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software.
    The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off
    updates for your specific device or software.

c.  Germany and Austria.

  i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially
  as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software.
  However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the
  licensed software.

  ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
  negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in
  case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
  according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
negligence.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF
USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING
DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or
third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract,
warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or
other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not
apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the
clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses
dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert «
tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et
péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez
bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la
protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou
elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de
qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de
contrefaçon sont exclues.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $
US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres
dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et
pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne:

• tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y
compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des
programmes tiers; et

• les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou
au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute
dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait
connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas
l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages
indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que
la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre
égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques.
Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays.
Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois
de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
