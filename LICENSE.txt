may be licensed under different terms (see third_party_software.txt). Except
for dxil.dll/libdxil.so, all those licenses are OSI approved. The files
dxil.dll and libdxil.so are licensed under a free but proprietary license,
but are only needed during development (compiling DX12 shaders). Any build of
WickedEngine that doesn't require on-the-fly compiling of DX12 shaders does
not depend on proprietary code.
