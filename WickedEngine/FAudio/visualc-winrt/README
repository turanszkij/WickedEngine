Building FAudio for UWP
-----------------------
FAudio uses Visual Studio 2017 to build on Xbox One.

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL2's source code from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Extract the ZIP file's SDL2 directory (called something like 'SDL2-2.0.8') as
a sibling to your FAudio checkout and rename it to 'SDL2', so that you have
directories named 'FAudio' and 'SDL2' next to each other.

Compiling
---------
1. Build SDL2/VisualC-WinRT/UWP_VS2015/SDL-UWP.sln
2. Build FAudio.sln
3. Grab FAudio.dll and SDL2.dll, ship it!
